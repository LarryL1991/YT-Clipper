# YT-Clipper

I started this project on the 19th of February 2021 to see if I could make a simple app with c#. You can see my progress that I made in the youtube videos below.

The project is simple enough. It used the executable from yt-dl.org in conjunction with FFMPEG to download a youtube video and trim it to specifications.

yt-dl seems to be broken so this project is no longer functional. It would be easy to fix if I could find a similar solution.
